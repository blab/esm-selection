Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however important for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

MissingOutputException in rule extract_node_fastas in file "/Users/Carlos/Desktop/Bedford/esm-selection/Snakefile", line 17:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
nextstrain_trees/nodeSeqs_PB2.fasta (missing locally, parent dir contents: flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y.json, .DS_Store, flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y_tip-frequencies.json, flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y_root-sequence.json)
