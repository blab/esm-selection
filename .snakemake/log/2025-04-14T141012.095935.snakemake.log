MissingOutputException in rule download_nextstrain_data in file "/Users/Carlos/Desktop/Bedford/esm-selection/Snakefile", line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
nextstrain_trees/flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y (missing locally, parent dir contents: flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y.json, flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y_tip-frequencies.json, flu_seasonal_h3n2_pb2_60y_root-sequence.json)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
